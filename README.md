# Ethereum tip jar

Welcome to the Ethereum Tip Jar, a blockchain-based application developed using Solidity. This digital "tip jar" allows you to show your appreciation to developers by leaving a tip in the form of Ethereum. Moreover, you can enhance your contribution with an optional message, making your support more personalized. Simply connect your wallet and share your generosity with the world!

## Built with:

- Solidity: An object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

- Next.js: A popular React.js framework for building JavaScript-based web applications.

- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used for styling and laying out web pagesâ€”for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.
